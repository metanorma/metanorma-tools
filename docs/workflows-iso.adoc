= ISO workflows with Metanorma Tools

== Purpose

This document provides guidance on using Metanorma Tools for ISO-specific
standards editing workflows.

Metanorma Tools supports the complete ISO standards editing lifecycle, from
document preparation through comment resolution and final publication. The
tools are designed to work with ISO's specific requirements and processes.

== Workflow

A project leader is required to perform these actions in the development of
an ISO document:

Step 1: Import the ISO source document into Metanorma from:

* from a Word file from ISO/CS;
* from a Word file from the Committee Secretariat;
* from an ISO STS / NISO STS XML file from ISO/CS;
* ... if all else fails we import at least the terms from the ISO OBP.


Step 2: Iterate the Metanorma ISO document stage by stage and balloting between stages

* progressing through stages PWI/NP/AWI/WD/WDS/CD/CDS/D[IS|TR|TS|AM|COR]/FD[IS|TR|TS|AM|COR]/PRF;
* iterate the document, update attributes of `stage`, `substage`, `revdate`, `vote-date-*`;
* create study review / ballot packages
** provide a Word file
** provide a PDF file
** at DIS / FDIS / PRF / IS, provide the DIS Word templated document to ISO/CS
** (this gem does this now!) provide a figure package
* at each stage, manage comments on the ISO commenting template synchronizing with the chosen issue system (e.g. GitHub Issues)
* at each stage, port commented changes back to the Metanorma source
* after comments are resolved, link the commits/PRs to the comment IDs
* upload package to the chosen CI/CD release platform (e.g. GitHub Releases) and mark milestone

Step 3: Enjoy the publication!


NOTE: The ISO DRG publishes the

that defines guidelines for the production of drawing files.

== Figure package and extraction

Extract a figure package with compliant ISO DRG filenames:

[source,shell]
----
$ metanorma-tools extract-images iso-document.presentation.xml --zip
# From ISO 690 edition 3
# => 690_ed3.zip (with figures 690_ed3figX.svg)
# From ISO/FDIS 19135 edition 2
# => 19135_fdis_ed2.zip (with figures 19135_fdis_ed2figX.svg)
----
