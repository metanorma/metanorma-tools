= ISO DRG compliance

== General

The ISO DRG (Document Review Group) requirements for document processing are
specified in the "DRG working instructions and directives" (August 2020), 3.1 "Revisable files".

3.1 provides a quote on their guidelines for submission:

Guidelines for the submission of text and graphics to ISO/CS (2020)

As a general rule, submitted graphic files (e.g. diagrams, technical drawings)
need to be revisable and language neutral (with the exception of flowcharts and
organigrams). All drawing elements within the graphics (lines, symbols, etc.)
must be modifiable, allowing ISO/CS to adjust or change them when necessary
during the editing process. All text elements must be editable, and not
pixelized or outlined text. In addition, the revisable graphic files are made
available to the ISO members for their publishing activities.

To this end, please submit revisable (vector-drawn) files. ISO/CS is not
responsible for redrafting graphics that are not revisable.

ISO/CS recommends the formats listed below:

* AutoCAD (.dwg or .dxf)
* Illustrator (.ai)
* Vector file type (.eps or .svg)
* Word (.doc .docx), Excel (.xls .xlsx), Powerpoint (.ppt .pptx), Visio (.vsd .vsdx)
* CorelDraw (.cdr)

The following formats may be used only for images, pictures, etc. where there
are no text elements:

* .png, .tif, .jpeg
____

The actual naming convention is as follows.


== File naming convention

The file naming requirements differ by document type.

In 3.2 "File names" two file name patterns are given but they are not
complete as these components are missing:

* subfigure (described in the block image and examples);
* key (described in the block image and examples);
* language (described in the block image and examples);
* development stages (not described).

Here we provide a complete pattern for the ease of understanding
and example listing.

There are four parts of the full filename pattern:

* document portion
* in-document portion
* language portion
* file extension portion

== Document portion

For Standard, TS, TR, PAS, IWA:

[source]
----
{StandardNumber}[-{partNumber}][_{stageCode}]_ed{editionNumber}
----

Where,

* `StandardNumber` is the standard number, e.g. `12345`;
* `partNumber` is the part number, e.g. `1`;
* `stageCode` is the stage code, one of: `pwi`, `np`, `awi`, `wd`, `cd`, `dis`, `fdis`, `prf` (final stage uses empty code);
* `editionNumber` is the edition number, e.g. `1`.

[example]
====
For the first edition of ISO 12345-1, the document portion is
`12345-1_ed1`.
====

NOTE: TR/TS do not use the codes "FDIS" etc. TODO ask ISO/CS what the proper codes are.

NOTE: The development stage is also provided.


For Amendments / Corrigenda:

[source]
----
{StandardNumber}-{partNumber}[_{stageCode}]_ed{editionNumber}{supplementCode}{supplementNumber}
----

Where,

* `StandardNumber` is the standard number, e.g. `12345`;
* `partNumber` is the part number, e.g. `1`;
* `stageCode` is the stage code, one of: `pwi`, `np`, `awi`, `wd`, `cd`, `dis`, `fdis`, `prf` (final stage uses empty code);
* `editionNumber` is the edition number, e.g. `1`;
* `supplementCode` is the supplement code. One of `amd`, `cor`;
* `supplementNumber` is the supplement number, e.g. `1`;

[example]
====
For the second amendment to the first edition of ISO 12345-2, the portion is
`12345-2_ed1amd2`.

For the second amendment at FDAM to the first edition of ISO 12345-2, the portion is
`12345-2_ed1amd2_fdis`.
====

NOTE: Amendments do not use the codes "FDIS" etc. TODO ask ISO/CS what the proper codes are.

NOTE: The development stage is also provided.


== In-document portion

There are 3 types of in-document types:

. figure and subfigure, where `subfigureAlphabet` is in lower alphabetic characters;
+
[source]
----
fig{figureNumber}[subfigureAlphabet][_{languageCode}]
----
+
[example]
====
"Figure 3" is represented as `fig3`.

Figure 3 in French is represented as `fig3_f`.

"Figure 3 a)" is represented as `fig3a`.

"Figure 3 a)" in French is represented as `fig3a_f`.

"Figure A.2" is represented as `figA2`.
====

. table, where `tableNumber` is in lower alphabetic characters;
+
[source]
----
{figurePortion}Tab{tableNumber}
----
+
[example]
====
"Table 3" is `figTab3`.

Second figure in "Table 1": `figTab1b`. (TODO Is this unnumbered?)
====

. figure key, representing an individual key as legend to the figure;
+
[source]
----
{figurePortion}_key{keyNumber}
----
+
[example]
====
Second key in "Figure 1": `fig1_key2`
====

. inline image in text, where `textNumber` is in lower alphabetic characters;
+
[source]
----
figText{textNumber}
----
+
[example]
====
First graphical element inline with text: `figText1`

Third graphical element inline with text: `figText3`
====


NOTE: There is also description of the "Special Layout" with such a pattern:
"File for table 1 which does not have a figure number" is assigned the file name
`SL12345-1_ed1figTab1.dwg`. Since I have no idea what the special layout is and
is likely rare to encounter, it is omitted from this.


== Language portion

Valid entries are:

`_e`:: English, but it is no longer needed
`_f`:: French
`_r`:: Russian
`_s`:: Spanish
`_a`:: Arabic
`_d`:: German


== Original filename preservation

When extracting figures from Metanorma documents, if the original image has a `filename` attribute, the ISO DRG pattern is extended to preserve the original filename:

[source]
----
{isoDRGpattern}_{originalFilename}.{extension}
----

Where:
* `isoDRGpattern` is the standard ISO DRG filename pattern as described above
* `originalFilename` is the original filename (without extension) from the `filename` attribute
* `extension` is the file extension

[example]
For Figure 1 with original filename "diagram-overview.png":
`12345-1_ed1fig1_diagram-overview.png`

For Figure A.2 subfigure a with original filename "flowchart.svg":
`12345-1_ed1figA2a_flowchart.svg`

This extended pattern ensures that:
1. Files follow ISO DRG naming conventions for proper document management
2. Original filenames are preserved for reference and traceability
3. The relationship between extracted figures and source documents is maintained

== File extension portion

ISO/CS (pretty much) only accepts these files.

Vector:

* AutoCAD (`.dwg` or `.dxf`)
* Illustrator (`.ai`)
* Vector file type (`.eps` or `.svg`)
* Word (`.doc`, `.docx`), Excel (`.xls`, `.xlsx`), Powerpoint (`.ppt`, `.pptx`), Visio (`.vsd`, `.vsdx`)
* CorelDraw (`.cdr`)

Raster (only useable when no text):

* Portable Network Graphics (`.png`)
* Tagged Image File Format (`.tif`)
* Joint Photographic Experts Group (`.jpeg`)


== Examples

The following examples are given by the source document.
